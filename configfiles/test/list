#this is a calibration/measurement file
#where the measurements and calibrations to do are defined
#meaning of measurement is a wavelength spectrum defined by a certain combination of LEDs
#each measurement need to be calibrated at least once
#The star indicates the concentration measurement
#
#this example says that 5 measurements are to be made
#and so 5 calibration are expected. If DAQ can't find those calibration, it will request them
#the timeNUM gives the number of days a calibration is considered valid
